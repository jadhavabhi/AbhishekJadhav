1. document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript";  // replaces the content of that id of html with the given content given by js query.here innerHTML give pointer to inner content
2. document.getElementById("demo").style.fontSize = "25px";   //to change/apply css on id;
3. document.getElementById("demo").style.display = "none";   // to hide the content

NOTE: 	Old JavaScript examples may use a type attribute: <script type="text/javascript">.
		The type attribute is not required. JavaScript is the default scripting language in HTML.
		Script can be written in both Head and Body part.
		External scripts cannot contain <script> tags.

4. 	Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.
	Writing into the HTML output using document.write().
	Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().
	Writing into the browser console, using console.log().

5.	Numbers are not allowed as the first character.
	This way JavaScript can easily distinguish identifiers from numbers.

6.	===	equal value and equal type
	!==	not equal value or not equal type
	
7.  javascript objects
	The values are written as name:value pairs (name and value separated by a colon).
	JavaScript objects are containers for named values.
	var car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"};
